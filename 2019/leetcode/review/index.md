# Review what I have solved

## linked list

## string manipulation

- brute force, traverse iterately, maybe back to iterate again and again, so it's slow
- so maybe thinging about how to not iterate back
- `slide window` is a active window (i, j), inside which are certain elems `3`
- dp, but may not the best solution, cause it usually take at least O(n^2) T

## array manipulation

- edge cases about boundary of array, like 0, length - 1
- matrix manipulation

## number manipulation

- overflow!
- 

## using hashmap (extra space for speed)

- for remove duplicates `Set`
- for finding one elem quickly `Map`
