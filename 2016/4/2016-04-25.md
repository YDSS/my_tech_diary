## Node Stream

> Benefits in using streams:

> - lazily produce or consume data in buffered chunks
> - evented and non-blocking
> - low memory footprint
> - automatically handle back-pressure
> - buffers allow you to work around the v8 heap memory limit
> - most core node.js content sources/sinks are streams already!
